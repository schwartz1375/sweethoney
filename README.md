# Sweethoney
Sweethoney is a file triaging tool.  The tool parses out the following information:

* PE header information
* Lists functions declared and referenced
* Lists exported symbols
* Calculates file statics
* Alerts on suspicious IAT - This is a static list, and it maybe need to be tuned for your use case!

For golang binaries please look at the [Go Reverse Engineering Tool Kit](https://go-re.tk/)
